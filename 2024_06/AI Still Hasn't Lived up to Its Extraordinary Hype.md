According to a recent study, only 50 percent of people have even heard of ChatGPT — by far the most widely known generative AI product ahead of Google's Gemini and Microsoft's Copilot.
After surveying 12,000 people from six different countries, lead researchers Dr. Richard Fletcher and Prof. Rasmus Kleis Nielsen found that while knowledge of ChatGPT isn't as common as you might expect, actual use of it is even rarer.
According to the study, only one percent of citizens in Japan use it on a daily basis, while two percent of English and French people have.Americans clock in at seven percent.

It's also worth pointing out that this recent study only focused on generative AI, rather than pre-existing AI-equipped voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant.
Speaking to the BBC, Dr. Fletcher concluded that there was a "mismatch" between the generative AI "hype" and the "public interest" in it.This might come as good news to anyone who's felt daunted or simply uninterested in the tech.
hype:大肆的宣传广告，炒作；（为做广告而进行的）欺骗；<非正式>皮下注射针，皮下注射；<非正式>有毒瘾者
daunted: 受到惊吓的，气馁的：因困难、危险或恐惧而感到畏缩的
But it's bad news for the companies who are making extraordinary claims about AI's potential to reshape the world as we know it.
Right now, every tech company is barrelling as fast as it can to incorporate AI into their products and services in some way, so as not to look behind the times.AI has the potential to change every industry the same way electricity and the internet did, but it's still too early in the game for it to know how things will shake out.

MISMATCH BETWEEN AI HYPE AND ACTUAL USE
It's important to keep all that in mind during this late spring and early summer period, when developer's conferences from the likes of Google, Microsoft, and Apple take place and provide an onslaught of AI-related news.
onslaught: 攻击，猛攻；（常指难以应付的）大批，大量；猛烈抨击
To state the obvious(说句显而易见的话): Big Tech is heavily, heavily invested in generative AI.It's essentially at the forefront of all of their visions going forward, while they attempt to integrate it into their products at a furious rate.Tech companies are pouring billions into partnerships and product development, but the general public is yet to be whipped up into their frenzy.
furious: 狂怒的，暴怒的；狂暴的，猛烈的；喧闹的，热烈兴奋的
whipped up into their frenzy: 激起了他们的狂热
Let's face it, any resistance to this emerging, and still mostly beta, generative AI tech isn't exactly unfounded.
Google's new AI-powered Gemini search, for instance, has a terrible hallucination problem, spitting out wrong and — frankly — dangerous results like telling people to glue cheese to their pizza or eat rocks.
hallucination:幻觉，幻想；错觉
frankly: 坦率地，直率地；（表示直言）老实说
spitting out: 吐出
And, if ChatGPT has already baked itself into your daily routine, then you'll no doubt have experienced a lot of crashes.GPT-4o, its new upgrade, could be faring even worse, as OpenAI rolled it out in a seemingly unfinished state.
GENERATIVE AI IS STILL IN BETA PHASE
When ChatGPT was unveiled towards the end of 2022, a flurry of fearmongering followed in its wake.
当ChatGPT在2022年底推出时，随之而来的是一阵恐慌。
News outlets around the world predicted that one large language model could have the potential to put billions out of business, destroy entire industries, and make life as we know it totally obsolete.
obsolete:淘汰的，废弃的；（生物特征的一部分）退化的
Yes, ChatGPT may have written the bad piece of marketing copy in the year-and-a-half since, but so far there's yet to really be any nightmares of electric sheep.
nightmare:梦魇，恶梦
With so many disastrous generative AI rollouts already, there will have to be a lot of improvements made to the tech — and fast — in order to close the pretty big gap between corporate hype and public engagement.
disastrous: 灾难性的，使损失惨重的；极失败的，很糟的
If this really is the dawn of a new AI age, then it's beginning with a whimper rather than a bang.
如果这真的是一个新的人工智能时代的黎明，那么它将以呜咽而不是砰的一声开始。
