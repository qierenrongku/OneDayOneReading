The study of how words affect our behavior and thinking is called psycholinguistics.Our words can act as sabers, often shaping relationships in ways we neither like nor understand.
psycholinguistics:心理语言学
saber: 军刀
While some psycholinguistic strategies for improving relationships can be difficult to apply, I have found four during my 30 years of clinical practice and research that are easy to use, apply to all ages, are gender-neutral, and are immediately effective.
clinical: 临床的
1.Converse Rather Than Question
1.Converse: 谈话
When I trained parents on how to interact with their children, I found an amazing correlation: When parents had conversations with their children, rather than bombarding them with questions, their children had significantly better language development.
correlation：相互关系 关联
I had similar positive results with adults: The more a conversational mode was used between adult partners, the better the relationship.
One theory explaining the more positive interactions was that in-depth conversations gave the impression of more interest in the speaker than just question-and-answer interactions.
Takeaway: By having "conversations" rather than just asking questions, the speaker will believe you are interested in what she is saying.
2.Eliminate or Minimize Negative Words
Eliminate: 剔除 淘汰 排除
The brain is like a giant sponge constantly searching for things it can connect.One pattern is "negativity."When you use negative words, the brain starts making connections with negative memories.What it retrieves may not have any connection other than that they are all negative.
The use of negative words has a multitude of unintended consequences, including casting what you, as the speaker, thought was neutral or positive into a negative experience for the listener.
sponge：海绵块
retrieve: 恢复 回忆
casting：投射 目光投向
Takeaway: When you eliminate or reduce the number of negative words you use, you deprive your brain and possibly your listener's brain of words that can conjure negative memories.As an experiment, try eliminating the word "no" from your vocabulary for one day.
deprive：剥夺
conjure： 变魔术 想象出
3. Apologize Rather Than Defend
How often have you been in a situation where you knew you were wrong but for a variety of reasons, decided to defend yourself with justifications you had to twist, scrunch, or push into an "I'm right" form that was a defense mechanism rather than a true accounting of facts?
justifications：正当理由，合理解释；证明为正当，辩护；齐行，整版；（上帝眼中的）称义
twist:使弯曲；（使）扭曲变形；扭动身体；扭伤（脚踝等）；旋转，转动；编织，捻在一起；缠绕；歪曲，曲解；蜿蜒，曲折；
scrunch: 发出嘎吱嘎吱的响声；把……揉成一团；使蜷缩，碾压；造发型
accounting:解释，说明；占（一定数量或比例）
What would have happened if instead of defending an indefensible position, you apologized for what you did or said — regardless of whether you believed it?(不管你是否相信)
When I did a horrible job of parking my car in a lot, upon returning, I was met by an individual who was complaining to anybody who listened about "the inconsiderate idiot who parked his car so I can't get into mine."
inconsiderate idiot: 不顾别人的傻瓜
Instead of explaining that I only did that because I was experiencing vision problems from an accident, I apologized profusely.The angry motorist stopped berating me in mid-sentence and then apologized for being rude.
profusely： 丰富的
motorist：汽车驾驶员
fall asleep in mid-sentence 说了一半就睡着了
Takeaway: Often, when we react emotionally, it is based not only on what happened but also on anticipation of what we think will happen.The motorist expected me to argue with him, so he emotionally prepared for a verbal fight.
emotionally：感情上；情绪上；令人激动地；情绪冲动地
anticipation：预期
verbal: 口头的，非书面的；用言辞的，文字的；动词的；多话的，爱说话的
When you react differently than what is expected, the person you are interacting with is often at a loss for what to do next, and the reaction tends not to include defensiveness.
4. Stop Being Judgmental
How often have you said something like, "If I were you, I would..." or "If it were me, I would..."These types of statements imply that your values are superior to those of the person whose behavior you are judging.
The problem is that we rarely acknowledge that we aren't the other person, nor ever will be.Yet the phrase implies that your judgment — because it is yours — is better than the other person's.Few things are more detrimental to a relationship than questioning a person's ethics or morality.（伦理或道德）
detrimental: 有害的，不利的
没有什么比质疑一个人的伦理道德更不利于一段关系了
Takeaway: Avoid using the phrase "If I were you…" or similar ones when judging the righteousness of someone's behaviors.A better approach is acknowledging differences in values as reflecting different life experiences rather than creating a hierarchy of whose values are better.
righteousness：正义；正直；公正；正当
hierarchy：等级制度；统治集团；等级体系
